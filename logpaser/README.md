# Log parsering 


1. Install Drain3

```
pip3 install drain3
```

2. Unzip ldap log file

```
unzip 80_01_paper.zip
```

3. Sorting log by conn to csv (note files path)

```
python3 preprocess_mui_pro.py
```

4. Merge all csv to one file.

```
python3 log80_30_tofile.py
```

5. remove date 

```
cat 2020_3mlogs.txt | python3 rm_date.py
```

6. convert log to log keys

```
cat 2020_log_3m_rmdate | python3 drain_ldap_l.py
```

# LDAP Dataset Description

The LDAP dataset was collected from the unified authentication system of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University with OpenLDAP, which is an open-source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The LDAP logs are de-identification, IP Address and user ID are anonymization. The collection period of testing data was from November 10, 2020 to January 1, 2021.

## Definition of one event
An event is composed of multiple rows of data. The length of rows depends on the type of event. Following is an example of event:

```
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 fd=8 ACCEPT from IP=192.168.0.1:12345 (IP=0.0.0.0:123)
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 op=0 BIND dn="cn=portal,ou=other,o=nctu" method=128
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 op=0 BIND dn="cn=portal,ou=other,o=nctu" mech=SIMPLE ssf=0
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 op=0 RESULT tag=97 err=0 text=
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 op=1 SRCH base="o=nctu" scope=2 deref=0 filter="(&(cn=0000000)(objectClass=person))"
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 op=1 SRCH attr=cn dn ou idno mail sn hit hitans l email
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 op=1 SEARCH RESULT tag=101 err=0 nentries=1 text=
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 op=2 UNBIND
Nov 10 15:59:23 proxy1 slapd[81950]: conn=69242 fd=8 closed
```

The number of conn is the ID of this event, 69242 is the ID in this example.  Normally, LDAP log start with "conn=XXX fd=X ACCEPT ..." and end with "conn=XXX fd=X closed". The operation logs between first raw and end raw have the same ID after "conn" in each raw. This example of an event is one raw of data after log parser.

## Data format of training and testing data
There are three parts in one raw dataï¼š event ID, log keys, and label.
Following is an example of data:

```
73704 1 2 1 1 3 4 4 5 5	0
```

The event ID is "73704". log keys are "1 2 1 1 3 4 4 5 5". The label is "0" which represents normal data, and "1" represent anomaly data.
